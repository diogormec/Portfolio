# üß¨ Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on the features computed from digitized images of breast mass biopsies.

The dataset used is the widely-known **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**. The primary objective of this project is to explore different classification algorithms, evaluate their performance, and build a robust predictive model.
