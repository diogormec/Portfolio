### üîç Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

A supervised machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a tumor is **malignant or benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset. This project explores several classification algorithms, model tuning strategies, and dimensionality reduction techniques to build a high-performance diagnostic tool.

**Key Highlights:**

* End-to-end ML pipeline: preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
* Compared multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, and ensembles (Voting Classifier).
* Applied **PCA** for visualization and dimensionality reduction.
* Achieved strong performance on multiple evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC AUC).
* Emphasized handling class imbalance and interpretability.

**Technologies:**
`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `PCA`, `Jupyter`

### üß∑ Zipper Object Detection with YOLOv8 (Roboflow Integration)

An object detection project focused on identifying **zippers in images** using YOLOv8. The dataset was prepared and managed via **Roboflow**, and the training was conducted on **Google Colab** using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework.

**Key Highlights:**

* Utilized the YOLOv8m model variant for real-time object detection.
* Full training and evaluation pipeline: data loading, augmentation, training, validation, and inference.
* Achieved **mAP50 of 0.97**, demonstrating high precision and recall on the custom zipper dataset.
* Visualized model performance through F1 and PR curves, and a confusion matrix.
* Suitable for industrial and fashion applications.

**Technologies:**
`YOLOv8`, `Roboflow`, `Ultralytics`, `Python`, `OpenCV`, `Google Colab`
