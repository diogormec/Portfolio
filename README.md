# ML Portfolio Projects

## 1. Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset - Model Creation for Binary Classification Prediction
Description:

This project involves creating a Machine Learning model to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer in patients using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The model was trained and validated using data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization techniques.

## 2. Random "Zipper" Images - YOLO Model Creation for "Zipper" Recognition
Description:

This project involves creating a YOLO model to recognize "zippers" in random images. The model was trained using deep learning and hyperparameter optimization techniques.
