# Project Name: **Roboflow - Zippers Object Detection with YOLOv8**

## üìå Overview
This project focuses on training a YOLOv8 model to detect zippers in images using the Roboflow platform. The notebook includes data loading, model training, validation, and performance evaluation. The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end object detection pipeline, leveraging Roboflow for dataset management and Ultralytics' YOLOv8 for state-of-the-art detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Roboflow**: For dataset management and augmentation.
- **YOLOv8**: For object detection (specifically YOLOv8m variant).
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Google Colab**: For cloud-based execution.
- **Ultralytics**: Library for YOLOv8 implementation.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.

## üìÇ Project Structure
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Download and preprocess the dataset from Roboflow.
   - Configure the YAML file for YOLOv8 training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train YOLOv8m on the zippers dataset.
   - Monitor training metrics (loss, mAP, etc.).

3. **Validation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on a validation set.
   - Generate performance metrics (precision, recall, mAP).

4. **Results**:
   - Visualize training curves (F1, PR, confusion matrix).
   - Save the best model weights for future use.

## üìä Key Metrics
- **mAP50**: 0.97 (Mean Average Precision at 50% IoU).
- **Precision**: 0.94.
- **Recall**: 0.875.

## üöÄ How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roboflow-zippers-detection.git
   cd roboflow-zippers-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install roboflow ultralytics opencv-python
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
   - Follow the steps to train and validate the model.

4. **Inference**:
   Use the trained model to detect zippers in new images:
   ```python
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   model = YOLO('best.pt')
   results = model.predict('your_image.jpg')
   ```

## üìà Performance Visualization
- **F1 Curve**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **PR Curve**: Precision-Recall trade-off.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Classification accuracy per class.

---

## üìù Notes
- The dataset consists of annotated zipper images, split into train/valid/test sets.
- The model achieves high accuracy, making it suitable for industrial or fashion-related applications.
